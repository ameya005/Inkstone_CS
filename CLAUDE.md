# Claude Code Session Notes

## Future Improvements (Post-Demo)

### 🤖 AI Response System
- **Replace hashmap with GPT-5-mini calls**
  - More natural language understanding
  - Better handling of spelling errors and synonyms
  - Context-aware responses
  - Easier to maintain and extend
  - Implementation: System prompt + few-shot examples + fallback to hashmap

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- **Docker Compose warnings**
  - Remove obsolete `version` attribute from docker-compose.yml
  - Update to modern Docker Compose syntax

### 🚀 Performance Optimizations
- **API Response Caching**
  - Cache common GPT responses to reduce API calls
  - Implement Redis or in-memory caching for frequent questions

### 📝 Code Quality
- **Error Handling**
  - Add better error handling for API failures
  - Graceful degradation when services are down
  - User-friendly error messages

### 🧪 Testing
- **Automated Testing**
  - Add unit tests for response generation
  - Integration tests for API endpoints
  - E2E tests for UI workflows

## Completed in This Session ✅

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Python service crashes** - Fixed `time.sleep()` blocking event loop (replaced with `asyncio.sleep()`)
- **500 errors** - Fixed Docker service communication (rebuilt containers with correct environment variables)
- **Empty responses** - Replaced complex nested if/elif with clean hashmap structure
- **Port conflicts** - Resolved port 3001 conflicts between services

### 🏗️ Architecture Improvements
- **Response system refactor** - Moved from nested conditionals to maintainable hashmap structure
- **Async fixes** - Proper async/await patterns throughout Python service
- **Service communication** - Fixed Express backend to Python service connectivity

### 🔄 Development Workflow
- **Container management** - Streamlined rebuild and restart processes
- **Debugging tools** - Established patterns for checking logs and testing APIs

## Commands for Future Reference

### Rebuild and restart services:
```bash
docker-compose build python-service && docker-compose restart python-service
```

### Test API endpoints:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/chat/ask-question \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "test", "userLevel": "beginner", "screenContext": "learning"}'
```

### Check service logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs python-service --tail=10
docker-compose logs express-backend --tail=10
```
